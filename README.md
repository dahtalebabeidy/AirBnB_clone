# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Description

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project aims to build a simplified version of the Airbnb platform, focusing on creating a command-line interface for managing AirBnB objects. The implementation involves creating a parent class, serialization/deserialization, and building classes for various AirBnB entities.
The project currently only implements the back-end console.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a crucial component of the project, enabling users to manage objects within the AirBnB clone. Here's a brief overview:

### How to Start

To start the command interpreter, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./console.py

### How to Use
Once the command interpreter is running, you can use the following commands:

help: Display a list of available commands.
quit: Exit the command interpreter.
